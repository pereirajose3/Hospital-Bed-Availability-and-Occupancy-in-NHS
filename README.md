# Hospital Bed Availability and Occupancy in NHS

Analyzing trends in hospital bed availability and occupancy across NHS hospitals in NHS Kent and Medway Integrated Care Board (ICB)
.

## Project Overview

This project examines NHS hospital bed utilization to monitor capacity, assess seasonal and regional variations, and provide insights into potential strain on hospital services. The analysis includes:

- Bed availability vs. occupancy trends over time  
- Regional and trust-level comparisons  
- Seasonal patterns and pressure during peak periods  
- Identification of capacity challenges 

The aim is to support proactive capacity planning, resource allocation, and system resilience across the ICB.

## Objectives

- Visualize historical and current bed occupancy rates  
- Compare trends across regions and hospital trusts  
- Identify peak pressure periods
- Equip NHS planners with data-driven insights

## Tools & Data Sources

- **Language:** Python with pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, pandas  
- **Data Sources:** NHS England bed availability and occupancy datasets
- **Notebooks:** Jupyter Notebooks covering data collection, cleaning, and analysis
